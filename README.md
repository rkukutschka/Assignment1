# Assignment Repository
by: Mariam Sanjush and Roberto Martinez B. Kukutschka

This is the repository created specifically for our class assignments:

##Assignment 1
The first assignment consists on accessing 2 different R core databases. 
The repository contains two files:  

  *escriptivesDiamonds.R- provides descriptive statistics of R's diamonds database.
  *DescriptivesInfertility.R- describes the infertility database.  
  
The first file (DescriptiveDiamonds.R) also contains a dynamic link to the second one.  

##Assignment 2 for the course MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis by @ChristopherGandrud at the Hertie School of Governance. We worked on our research proposal regarding the role of different transparency measurements on grand corruption in the EU. The second assignment consists of 2 files:  
 
 *Assiggnment2.RMD contains the Markdown code and format for the article.
 *Bibliography.bib contains the sources consulted for the proposal.

 Any feedback, comments, and ideas are encouraged.
